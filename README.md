Introduction

SecureVoice is a project aimed at enhancing the security of voice assistants. With the increasing adoption of voice-activated devices, ensuring the privacy and security of user data has become crucial. This project provides tools and methods to protect voice assistants from various security threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and eavesdropping.
Features

    Voice Authentication: Implements voice biometrics to authenticate users.
    Secure Data Transmission: Encrypts data communicated between the voice assistant and the server.
    Anomaly Detection: Monitors and detects unusual activities or commands.
    Access Control: Configurable permissions and access controls for different users.
    Privacy Mode: Ensures sensitive conversations are not recorded or processed.

Installation

To install and set up the SecureVoice project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureVoice.git
cd SecureVoice

Install dependencies:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file and add your configuration variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

Run the application:

sh

    python app.py

Usage
Voice Authentication

    Enroll a new user:

    sh

python enroll_user.py --username <USERNAME> --voice_sample <PATH_TO_VOICE_SAMPLE>

Authenticate a user:

sh

    python authenticate_user.py --username <USERNAME> --voice_sample <PATH_TO_VOICE_SAMPLE>

Secure Data Transmission

SecureVoice uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data. Ensure you have valid SSL certificates and configure your server to use them.
Anomaly Detection

Configure anomaly detection settings in config.yaml:

yaml

anomaly_detection:
  threshold: 0.8
  alert_email: admin@example.com

Configuration

Configuration options are available in the config.yaml file. You can customize settings such as authentication methods, encryption keys, and anomaly detection parameters.

yaml

auth:
  method: voice_biometrics
  voice_biometrics:
    min_confidence: 0.85

encryption:
  method: AES256
  key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY

anomaly_detection:
  enabled: true
  threshold: 0.8
  alert_email: admin@example.com
